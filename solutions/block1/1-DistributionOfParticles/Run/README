## Variables
- N: the number of particles
- P: the number of compartments
- Ncycle: the number of cycles, the actual number of cycles equals to Ncycle * CycleMultiplication (1000)
- Distribution: with dimension of P * N, the histogram of the number of particles in each compartment
- NumInComp: P-dimension array, the number of particles in each compartment

## pseudo codes
```
// initialization

// run the cycles
for each cycle
    // distribute particles over the compartments
    for each particle
        choose a compartment randomly
        place the particle in the chosen compartment

    // compute the histogram
    for each compartment
        count the times of finding x (0 to N) particles in this compartment

// write the results
Distribution -> results.dat
// write analytical distribution (Theoretical distribution can be found below) -> analytical.dat
```

# Probability distribution
The probability of finding $n_1$ particles in a certain compartment:
$$ P(n_1) = \frac{N!}{n_1! \times (N-n_1)!} \times (\frac{1}{p})^{n_1} (\frac{p-1}{p})^{N-n_1}
$$

## When $n_1$ = 0
$$
P(0) = (\frac{p-1}{p})^N
$$
When $N>>p$, 
$$
\lim_{N\to\infty}P(0) = 0
$$

## Description of the distribution
The peak of the distribution is at $N/p$.
